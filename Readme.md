# smol-string

`smol-string` is a compression library designed for use with browsers' `localStorage` (and `sessionStorage`). It serves as a faster alternative to [`lz-string`](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string).

The library is composed of a core algorithm written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) compiled to WebAssembly, along with a wrapper provided as a TypeScript library.

Originally, I ensured that it produced valid UTF-16 strings to ensure browser compatibility. However, it now appears that this is not necessary for any of the tested browsers. The default behavior can now result in technically invalid UTF-16 strings.

## Installation

```
npm install -S smol-string
```

## Usage

```ts
import { compress, decompress } from "smol-string";

const input = "Any JS String";

const compressed = compress(input);
const decompressed = decompress(compressed);
```

An async version offloading the processing to a webworker is also available. API is identical, except that each function returns a promise:

```ts
import { compress, decompress } from "smol-string/worker";

const compressed = await compress(input);
const decompressed = await decompress(compressed);
```

## Build

```sh
zig build         # Builds the wasm modules to `zig-out/lib/` by default.
```

```sh
cd ts-lib
npm ci            # Installs dependencies.
npm run wasm-opt  # (Optional) Run wasm-opt on the wasm module generated by zig and copies it for the TS library. 
                  #   Only needed if you made changes to the zig library.
npm run build     # Builds the Typescript library to `ts-lib/dist`.
```
